Challenge Name: Dropdown Menu

Description: The Dropdown Menu challenge involves creating a user interface that allows users to select an option from a dropdown menu and display the selected option on the screen.

Skills Required:
1. HTML: To structure the basic layout of the user interface.
2. CSS: To style the dropdown menu and make it visually appealing.
3. JavaScript: To implement the functionality of displaying the selected option on the screen dynamically.

Step by Step Solution:
1. Create an HTML file with a basic structure and include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.
2. Within the HTML body, add an empty `<div>` element to display the selected option.
3. Create a `<select>` element with multiple `<option>` tags within it. Each `<option>` tag represents a different option in the dropdown menu.
4. Add an event listener to the `<select>` element that triggers a JavaScript function whenever the user selects a different option.
5. In the JavaScript function, retrieve the selected option using the `.value` property of the `<select>` element.
6. Modify the content of the previously created `<div>` element to display the selected option dynamically using JavaScript.

Expected Result:
When the user selects an option from the dropdown menu, the selected option should be displayed on the screen within the `<div>` element.
